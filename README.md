# Form-Validation
I have created this form Validation Website using HTM,CSS and Javascript
Form Validation Project
This project demonstrates a form validation page created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes fields for username, email, password, and confirm password. It provides real-time validation feedback to the user, ensuring that the input meets the specified criteria before submission. If the form is valid, it redirects to a new page and displays the entered information.
